## 🧩 Outside of Work

When I’m not diving into data, you’ll probably find me deep in a game of chess ♟️—a hobby that’s sharpened my strategic thinking and love for patterns. I also enjoy exploring the creative side of tech, catching up on AI trends, and spending time reflecting at outdoors when I need to reset and recharge.

Always up for good conversations, unexpected insights, and the next challenge to solve!
